## Synopsis

-   Climate change continues to be perceived as a significant risk among Americans, especially among younger demographics

-   Millennials were found to be the group most adamant about prioritizing climate change

-   71% of Millennials said climate change is the most important issue in order to protect and sustain the planet

## Background

## Laura's Journey

-   I signed up for class wanting to learn if I'm a quantitative or qualitative researcher
-   My advisor told me R would be a helpful skill
-   Class was hard - the hardest class I've ever had
-   I learned I am NOT a quantitative researcher and that R is much more difficult than I realized
-   Presentations in Quarto were actually the easiest part of the class for me!

## Sam's Journey

-   Prior to pursuing my PhD, I didn't have much experience as an academic researcher.
-   After taking classes in both methods, I felt more inclined towards quantitative research methods, so I signed up for this class.
-   Having no prior experience with R, I didn't know what to expect. (Spoiler Alert: It hasn't been easy)
-   BUT it has been the right amount of challenging to keep me intrigued.

## Sam's Journey Part Two

-   I've spent so many days and hours sitting and trying to figure out all of the assignments.
-   All the frustration didn't compare to feeling of euphoria I had when my code would finally run.
-   So, now I know for sure I'm a quant-leaning researcher.
-   I declared the specialization in Educational Data Science and am enrolled in EDLD652 next term.

## Megan's Journey

-   I took this class to expand my research skills
-   And to better than my partner at 'R'!

## Update:

## Megan's Journey

-   All jokes aside, while 'R' has literally been like learning a new language - I better understand the potential 'R' has to improve my future work
-   I have confirmed I'm not exactly a numbers person but, ggplot \< - useful
-   After this class I probably won't pursue more data science courses, but will absolutely continue the various bootcamps and take in data science at a slower pace

## Emmanuel's Journey

-   Started Grad School (Masters) with a phobia for maths and numbers
-   Ended up with a quantitative experiment thesis on health communication
-   I started with SPSS (which is common in communication research) and it was actually easier to work with.

## Emmanuel's Journey Part Two

-   Learning R is hard!! But genuinely worth it. I realize I could do even more with R.
-   Of course, because I am now very quantitative, it is one of the standard data analysis tools, meaning I should know it.
-   This class gave me an opportunity to appreciate it more.

## Successes

-   Getting charts to run!
-   This project was sent into a large conference and we're hopeful it gets accepted

## Successes

## Current Challenges

-   Waiting for the other results (we have 300ish more surveys heading our way!)
-   Analyzing all questions from the survey (we shortened the list of questions to five for this project)
- Working with a team of varying R proficiency

## Challenges

## Findings
-   We found that those who describe themselves as Gen-Z were likely to say media is effective at providing climate change information.
- However, they are less likely than millenials to say they desire to have children.

## Future R Hurdles

- Coding all the questions for the paper we submitted to ICA
- Running the statistical test
- Joining the new data set with the current data set

## Thanks!
